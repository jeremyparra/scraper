## Unit 18 Homework

#### Notes from Development

***

I was unable to get full functionality on this in a resonable amount of time. I feel like I get what I need to do to complete the task, but I have put a lot of time into this and I dont want to fall too far behind.

I feel like my code is probably a little cluncky and I wouldn't see this as a finished product. I suppose that if I can see the errors and drawnout mistakes, I am that much better off. Solving them is a seperate concept.

As I uploaded I realize that I decontructed my handlebars to simplify and try to get functionality before building handlebars back out. All that I can say is that I will go back to this one and try to sort it out for my portfolio, but probably not before class is done.

Thank you for your consideration.
